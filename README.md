Audeo is a website for french students of preparatory class. Take a look by [clicking here](http://audeo.ml){:target="_blank"}.

### What for ?
After a buisness prep, french students will take the competitive entrance examinations to graduate business schools. But as clever students they can't take all exams. It would be a waste of time to work for exams they'll never pass !

So, to help them estimate if a exam worth a try, I made this tool.

  1. You put the expencted marks
